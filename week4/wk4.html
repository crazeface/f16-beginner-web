		<h1>Lesson 4: Webpages</h1>
		<p>We're finally at the level where we can make our own webpages! This process is a bit messy and complicated, though, so let's try to understand every step of the way.</p>
		<img height=450 width=800 src="http://upcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/html-css-js-logos.png">
		<p>If you haven't already, download a text editor of some sort. I recommend <a href="https://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 3</a> since it's pretty popular for web development and for coding in general if you don't have a dedicated IDE.</p>

		<h2>CSS</h2>
		<p>Before we get there, though, there's one last component of webpages we haven't spent very much time on: CSS. This is how we make our page look nice.</p>
		<p>CSS code has two main components: the selector and the specific style. The style tells our page what we want a given element to look like, and the selector tells our page which elements to apply those styles to.</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  /* Applied to all h1 */
  h1{
    font-size: 64px;
    margin: 30px auto;
  }
		</pre></code></p>
		<p>The styles themselves, though, don't really have any consistent rules on how to use them. This is where the Internet comes in.</p>
		<p>Simply typing your goal into Google will usually give you a demonstration on how to do it.</p>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<img width=400 height=200 class="embeddedimg" src="http://howtocodeinhtml.com/img/chapter7/class-schema.png">
		<p>It's fine to add to specific kinds of elements, but it's even more helpful to decide which elements get a given style.</p>
		<p>That's where HTML <i>classes</i> come in.</p>
		<p>Classes are like groups of styles that we bundle together and can assign straight into our HTML with the class attribute.</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  /* Defines a CSS class called embeddedimg */
  .embeddedimg{
    float: right;
    margin: 30px 30px;
  }

  And in your HTML:
  
  &lt;img class="embeddedimg" ... &gt; 
        </pre></code></p>
		<p>So we can add a given set of styles arbitrarily by adding the class attribute to our HTML.</p>

		<h2>Modifying with JavaScript</h2>
		<p id="toModify">All these styles are useful, but they really get interesting when we can modify them with our JavaScript.</p>
		<p>The best way to do that is with classes:</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  var para = document.getElementById("toModify");
  para.classList.add("testClass");
		</pre></code></p>
		<p>You can add individual styles through Javascript, but it gets messy. Classes are a way to not have to worry about individual styles while writing JavaScript.</p>
		<p>If we want to switch back and forth between two states, the toggle function becomes helpful:</p>
		<p><code><pre>
  //Removes the class if it's there
  //And adds it if it's not.			  
  para.classList.toggle("testClass");
		</pre></code></p>

		<h2>Make Your Own</h2>
		<p>Try experimenting as much as possible. I've tried to explain as much as I can in the comments on the page, but this is a lot to take in. The best way to get familiar with building a page is to try it, after all. </p>
		<p><a href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/propindex/all.htm">Here</a> is a list of common CSS properties that you can try messing with!</p>

		<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
		<p>That was a lot, but now you know enough to try making your own pages. The main thing left to get familiar with webpages is practice.</p>
